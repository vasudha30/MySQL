    "Temporary tables are created when FROM clause and JOIN statement are first executed to decide the total values in rows and columns used in query.  \n",

    "### 3. GROUP BY\n",
    "Then grouping is done based on the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. So there will only be as many rows as there are unique values in that column. It means that we need to use this when we have aggregate functions in our query. \n",
