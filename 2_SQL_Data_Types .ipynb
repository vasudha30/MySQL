    "## SQL DATA TYPES\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Data Types** define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a database table. They help ensure data integrity, optimize storage, and provide meaning to the data stored in the database. SQL data types can be broadly categorized into the following groups:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: The \"n\" in CHAR(n) and VARCHAR(n) represents the maximum length of the string, and \"p\" and \"s\" in DECIMAL(p, s) represent precision and scale, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different database systems might have additional or slightly different data types, but the ones listed above are widely supported in most SQL database systems. The choice of data type depends on the nature of the data you want to store and the specific requirements of your application."

    "### SQL DATE/ DATE-TIME FORMAT\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, date formats are used to represent and manipulate dates and times in a human-readable format. The most commonly used SQL date format is the ISO 8601 format, which is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' for dates and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' for date and time. However, SQL provides various date functions and formatting options to convert dates to different formats as needed. Here are some important SQL date formats and functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ISO 8601 Format:**\n",
    "   - Date Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' (e.g., '2023-05-21')\n",
    "   - DateTime Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' (e.g., '2023-05-21 09:30:15')\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formatting Dates using DATE_FORMAT:**\n",
    "   The DATE_FORMAT function is used to format dates into custom representations. It takes two arguments: the date column or value and the format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%d-%b-%Y') AS formatted_date\n",
    "   FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output: '21-May-2023'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting Date Components using EXTRACT:**\n",
    "   The DATE_PART function is used to extract specific components (e.g., year, month, day) from a date or timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,\n",
    "       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,\n",
    "       EXTRACT(DAY FROM order_date) AS order_day\n",
    "   FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   | order_year | order_month | order_day |\n",
    "   |------------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "   | 2023       | 5           | 21        |\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Date Arithmetic:**\n",
    "   SQL allows performing arithmetic operations on dates using addition or subtraction. For example, you can calculate the difference between two dates or add/subtract days, months, or years from a date.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT order_date,\n",
    "           DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY) AS future_date,\n",
    "           DATE_SUB(order_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS past_date\n",
    "    FROM orders;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   | order_date | future_date | past_date  |\n",
    "   |------------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "   | 2023-05-21 | 2023-05-28  | 2023-04-21 |\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the common SQL date formats and functions that allow you to work with dates and times effectively in SQL queries. The specific functions and formats available may vary depending on the SQL database management system you are using (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server). Always refer to the documentation of your specific database system for the complete list of date functions and supported formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in SQL, various functions and operators are available to work with date and time data. These functions and operators allow you to manipulate, format, and perform calculations on dates and times. Here are the essential functions and operators for date formats in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CURRENT_DATE:**\n",
    "   - Returns the current date (excluding time) in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT CURRENT_DATE;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or NOW():**\n",
    "   - Returns the current date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS'.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DATE_ADD and DATE_SUB:**\n",
    "   - Used to add or subtract a specific interval (e.g., days, months, years) to/from a date.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT order_date,\n",
    "          DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY) AS future_date,\n",
    "          DATE_SUB(order_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS past_date\n",
    "   FROM orders;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DATEDIFF or DATE_PART:**\n",
    "   - Calculates the difference between two dates or timestamps.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT DATEDIFF(delivery_date, order_date) AS days_to_delivery\n",
    "   FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **TIMESTAMPDIFF:**\n",
    "   - Calculates the difference between two timestamps based on a specific unit (e.g., day, hour, minute).\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, start_time, end_time) AS hours_elapsed\n",
    "   FROM tasks;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the essential functions and operators used for date formats in SQL. The exact set of functions and operators available may vary depending on the SQL database management system you are using. Always refer to the documentation of your specific database system for the complete list of date functions and supported formats."
