    "\n",
    "5. **Configure Connection Profiles:**\n",
    "   When you first launch SQL Workbench, you'll need to set up connection profiles for the databases you want to work with. This involves providing connection details like hostname, port, username, and password. Click on \"Manage Drivers\" to set up database drivers if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Start Querying:**\n",
    "   After setting up connection profiles, you can start writing and executing SQL queries using SQL Workbench. You'll have access to a query editor where you can write, test, and execute SQL statements against your connected databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that specific installation steps might vary based on your operating system. Always refer to the official documentation or resources provided by SQL Workbench for the most accurate and up-to-date installation instructions."
