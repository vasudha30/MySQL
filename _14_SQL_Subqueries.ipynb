    "# Subqueries:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, subqueries on a single table can be used to perform a variety of tasks such as filtering, aggregation, and data manipulation without needing to join with other tables. Here, I'll explain several types of subqueries that operate on a single table, along with SQL examples to demonstrate how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### table for queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    department_id INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary, department_id) VALUES\n",
    "(1, 'Alice Smith', 75000.00, 101),\n",
    "(2, 'Bob Johnson', 54000.00, 102),\n",
    "(3, 'Charlie Davis', 84000.00, 103),\n",
    "(4, 'Diana Reynolds', 92000.00, 101),\n",
    "(5, 'Ethan Taylor', 61000.00, 102),\n",
    "(6, 'Fiona Green', 58000.00, 103),\n",
    "(7, 'George White', 76000.00, 101),\n",
    "(8, 'Hannah Brown', 67000.00, 102),\n",
    "(9, 'Ian Clark', 43500.00, 103),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Scalar Subqueries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar subquery returns a single value and can be used in the SELECT, WHERE, or HAVING clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a table employees with columns id, name, and salary. You can find the average salary and list employees earning more than the average:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Column Subqueries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Column subqueries return one or more columns or rows. These are typically used in the WHERE clause to filter rows based on conditions evaluated against columns returned by the subquery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Find the employees with the minimum and maximum salaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary IN (SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees)\n",
    "   OR salary IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Row Subqueries:**\n",
    "Row subqueries return one or more rows. They can be used in the WHERE clause alongside operators like IN, EXISTS, or comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Find the employees who have the top three salaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary IN (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Correlated Subqueries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlated subquery refers to elements from the outer query. It executes once for each row processed by the outer query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "List employees who earn more than the average salary in their respective departments (assuming there's a department_id in the table):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees e1\n",
    "WHERE salary > (\n",
    "  SELECT AVG(salary)\n",
    "  FROM employees e2\n",
    "  WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Subqueries as Derived Tables:**\n",
    "Subqueries can also be used in the FROM clause as a derived table, providing a temporary set of rows for the main query to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Calculate the average salary of the top five earners:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT AVG(salary)\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "  SELECT salary\n",
    "  FROM employees\n",
    "  ORDER BY salary DESC\n",
    "  LIMIT 5\n",
    ") AS top_earners;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**6. Subqueries for Aggregation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries can perform complex aggregations before the main query processes the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Find the number of employees earning above average:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate how subqueries can be utilized on a single table to perform complex SQL operations, allowing for powerful data analysis without the need for joins. Each serves a specific purpose, from filtering and aggregation to deriving new tables for further analysis."
