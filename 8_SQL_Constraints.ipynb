    "# SQL Constrains \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are SQL CONSTRAINTS? \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL constraints are rules and conditions applied to columns or tables in a relational database to enforce data integrity and maintain the accuracy, consistency, and validity of the stored data. Constraints ensure that the data stored in the database meets certain predefined criteria, preventing the insertion of incorrect or inconsistent data. They play a crucial role in maintaining data quality and preventing data anomalies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How SQL CONSTRAINS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how SQL constraints work in different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Ensures uniqueness and non-null values in a column designated as the primary key.\n",
    "   - When inserting a new row, the DBMS checks if the primary key value already exists in the table. If it does, the insertion is rejected.\n",
    "   - When updating the primary key value, the DBMS checks for uniqueness conflicts before allowing the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that values in a column are unique, except for null values.\n",
    "   - When inserting or updating data, the DBMS verifies if the new value conflicts with existing values in the column. If it does, the operation is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Foreign Key Constraint or REFERENTIAL KEY:**\n",
    "   - Ensures referential integrity by enforcing relationships between tables.\n",
    "   - When inserting or updating data in a child table with a foreign key column, the DBMS checks if the referenced value exists in the parent table. If not, the operation is rejected.\n",
    "   - When deleting data from the parent table, the DBMS can enforce actions like cascading deletes, nullifying foreign key values, or rejecting the deletion based on the constraint definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not Null Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Prevents the insertion of null values into a column.\n",
    "   - When inserting data, the DBMS checks if a value is provided for the column. If not, the insertion is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Validates data against a specified condition before insertion or update.\n",
    "   - When inserting or updating data, the DBMS evaluates the condition. If it evaluates to false, the operation is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Default Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Sets a default value for a column when no value is provided during insertion.\n",
    "   - When inserting data without specifying a value for the column, the DBMS automatically uses the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints help maintain data integrity and consistency by preventing data anomalies such as duplication, inconsistency, and invalid references. They ensure that data adheres to the business rules and requirements set by the database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how constraints work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" The \"Customers\" table has a primary key constraint on the \"CustomerID\" column, ensuring that each customer has a unique identifier. The \"Orders\" table has a foreign key constraint that references the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This foreign key constraint ensures that an order can only be associated with a valid customer ID present in the \"Customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone tries to insert an order with a non-existent customer ID in the \"Orders\" table, the foreign key constraint will prevent the operation, maintaining the integrity of the data and preventing orphaned records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL constraints play a critical role in ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data in a relational database. By enforcing rules on data entry and manipulation, constraints help create a trustworthy and well-structured database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use SQL CONTRAINTS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SQL constraints involves adding rules to columns or tables during table creation or altering an existing table. These rules enforce data integrity and ensure that the stored data meets certain criteria. Here's how to use common SQL constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Ensures uniqueness and non-null values in a column.\n",
    "   - Applied to a single column or a combination of columns.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "         StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         Age INT\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Ensures uniqueness of values in a column, except for null values.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "         EmployeeID INT,\n",
    "         EmployeeCode VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,\n",
    "         Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         Department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Foreign Key Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Establishes relationships between tables and enforces referential integrity.\n",
    "   - Ensures values in a column match values in another table's primary key column.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "         OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         CustomerID INT,\n",
    "         OrderDate DATE,\n",
    "         FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not Null Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Ensures a column cannot contain null values.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Products (\n",
    "         ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         ProductName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "         Price DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Validates values before insertion or update based on a specified condition.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "         EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         Age INT,\n",
    "         Gender CHAR(1),\n",
    "         Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "         CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Salary > 0)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Default Constraint:**\n",
    "   - Sets a default value for a column if no value is provided during insertion.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "         OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         OrderDate DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,\n",
    "         TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply constraints to an existing table, use the `ALTER TABLE` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Age CHECK (Age >= 18);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that constraints play a vital role in data integrity and consistency. They prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being entered into the database. When designing a database schema, carefully consider which constraints are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We will explore ALTER TABLE commands in the next chapter.)"

    "**Various types of key constrains in SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, keys are crucial for identifying and establishing relationships between records in a relational database. There are several types of keys that serve different purposes in maintaining data integrity and structure. Let's explore each key type in detail with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Primary Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It ensures that no two records have the same key value.\n",
    "- Each table can have only one primary key, and it cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "- Example: Consider a \"students\" table with a primary key \"student_id.\"\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "-It ensures referential integrity, maintaining the connection between related data.\n",
    "-Example: Consider an \"orders\" table with a foreign key \"customer_id\" referencing the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Unique Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A unique key ensures that the values in the key column(s) are unique across the table, similar to a primary key.\n",
    "- Unlike a primary key, a unique key can allow NULL values, but if a value is present, it must be unique.\n",
    "- Example: Adding a unique key constraint on the \"email\" column of a \"users\" table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    username VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
